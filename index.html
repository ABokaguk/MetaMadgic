                            Blockchain, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality can all be fully enjoyed within a

                            Meta Magic is the most beloved and cherished comprehensive art of humanity. It has evolved
                            from the center of magicians with a 5000-year history to magic enjoyed by everyone with a
                            smartphone. <br>
                            <br>
                            Magic, which was once simply watched and enjoyed, has evolved into something that people can
                            imitate and enjoy, and further into an era where magic can be distributed and determined by
                            oneself. It marks the beginning of the world's first magic platform where users can request
                            magic from magicians, choose magicians, and earn money and invest just by watching magic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For the first time ever, magic that has never been seen before and has not been shown on any
                            streaming service can unfold, and people can vote and invest in their works. <br>
                            <br>
                            The Meta Magic Universe absorbs the development of the platform and smart devices at the
                            fastest pace and ultimately can become the ultimate magic-exclusive theater in the universe.
                            You can watch and communicate with them from anywhere, even from the VIP lounge without
                            having to take a plane. With just a smartphone, even penguins in Antarctica can become
                            users, and elders on the Ganges can enjoy and watch magic while earning money and receiving
                            investments by showcasing their own magic. <br>
                            <br>
                            You will be happy. If you have only enjoyed amateur magic on platforms like YouTube or
                            TikTok, now try creating the ultimate happiness in true magic and fantasy. This is Meta
                            Magic. <br>

                <p>Meta Magic (MM) operates the Magic Coin (MC) system. Within MM, it encourages the use of Magic Points
                    (MP) instead of cards or cash. Users can recharge MP at the Magic Charging Station and collect
                    reward MP through various promotional activities. Accumulated MP in the electronic wallet can be
                    utilized to purchase magic props, daily necessities, fashion items, goods (vouchers), etc., from the
                    Magic Shopping Mall. Additionally, users can promote their channels, purchase thousands of paid
                    contents and subscriptions at the International Magic Carnival (IMC), and help those in need through
                    the donation center.</p><br><br>
                <p>Furthermore, at the Magic Coin Exchange, users can convert their held MPoints into MCoin, which can
                    then be exchanged for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Through this, Meta Magic (MM)
                    will also serve as a more efficient global hyper-chain-based coin exchange center.</p>
